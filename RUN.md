# Running AI26

## Prerequisites

- Linux: the single-processor ownership lock and launcher use POSIX process groups.
- Python 3.12 (`backend/.python-version`), `uv`, Node.js 22.12+ and npm.
- Internet for initial dependencies/models and browser map tiles/fonts. Vehicle
  models initialize in the background; ALPR initializes only for plate inputs.
- The committed lock selects CPU PyTorch on Linux. GPU setup is a separate,
  untested configuration; a normal frozen sync must not select CUDA packages.

## Startup and restart

```bash
uv run run.py
# Subsequent starts after dependencies were installed:
uv run run.py --skip-install
```

Open http://localhost:5174. Ctrl+C or SIGTERM stops both service process groups,
including their child processes. Allow up to 35 seconds for inference shutdown.
Only one API worker may own a data directory. Do not use Uvicorn `--workers` or
`--reload` with processing enabled. Stop the existing instance before restarting.
Observations remain in SQLite; a restart creates new replay/track sessions.

The first command runs `uv sync --frozen` and `npm ci`; `--skip-install` reuses
those installations. If the lock or package manifest changes, run the first
command again. A process exiting stops its sibling automatically.

## Configuration

The launcher does not load the root `.env` automatically. Export it first:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
uv run run.py
```

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AI26_BACKEND_PORT` | `8001` | Launcher API port and frontend proxy target |
| `AI26_FRONTEND_PORT` | `5174` | Frontend port and API CORS origins |
| `AI26_API_TARGET` | `http://127.0.0.1:8001` | Optional frontend proxy override |
| `AI26_FOOTAGE_ROOT` | `backend/data/footage` | Original input root |
| `AI26_DATA_ROOT` | `backend/data` | SQLite and content-addressed JPEG storage |
| `AI26_PROCESSING_ENABLED` | `1` | Set `0` for API/fixture tests without models |
| `AI26_TOTAL_INFERENCE_FPS` | `2` | Total scheduled sampling budget, clamped 0.1–10 |
| `AI26_TIMEZONE` | `Asia/Kolkata` | Calendar/time interpretation for query intents |

Sampling is sequential and skips through recorded clips using elapsed replay
position. Two scheduled frames/second is a budget, not a guaranteed throughput.
Health exposes actual per-camera FPS, frame age, latency and errors. No growing
capture queue is used. The API ports differ from Godseye's 8000/5173.

## Footage

The six H.264 proxies `backend/static/playback/CAM-01.mp4` through `CAM-06.mp4`
support local playback and vehicle inference. For CAM-07–09 provide these files
under `AI26_FOOTAGE_ROOT`:

```text
numberplate-vids/clip 4.mp4
numberplate-vids/clip_2_00_25-00_50.mp4
numberplate-vids/clip_2_00_30-01_00.mp4
```

Alternatively supply H.264 MP4 proxies at `backend/static/playback/CAM-07.mp4`,
`CAM-08.mp4`, and `CAM-09.mp4`. Additional clips and data are ignored by Git.
Originals take precedence for inference; H.264 proxies take precedence for browser
playback. Camera locations are demo metadata. Replacing inputs requires updating
`backend/cameras.py` and independently validating locations and recording clocks.

The nine configured cameras stay visible; availability explicitly reports six
available and three missing until supplied. Missing video/stream returns 404;
a present source without a fresh processed snapshot returns 503. Processing
starts with the API, independent of which dashboard page is open.

## Separate processes

```bash
# Terminal 1, repository root:
uv sync --frozen --directory backend
uv run --frozen --directory backend uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
# Terminal 2:
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

API catalog: http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/cameras; processing health:
http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/health; interactive docs: http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs.
A production frontend needs separate `/api` routing; Vite's proxy is development
configuration. Model/capture failures appear in health and retry after 10 seconds.

## Checks and evaluation

```bash
uv run --frozen --directory backend python -m unittest discover -s ../tests -v
python evaluation/evaluate.py --records evaluation/example.jsonl --output evaluation/results/fixture.json
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Tests disable background inference and use temporary databases and deterministic
fixtures. The evaluation example is explicitly synthetic; its metrics prove the
metric implementation, not real detector/OCR accuracy. See `evaluation/README.md`
for the labeled JSONL format. Do not recursively compile the backend virtualenv.

## Data and exports

The database and artifacts are local, ignored files. Back up the data directory
with the API stopped (SQLite uses WAL while running). Default views cover the last
five minutes; explicit date/time queries access retained history. Observations
and source JPEG derivatives are cleaned after seven days, reports expire after
24 hours. Active reports lease their referenced images until report expiry.
Maintenance runs independently of inference. Missing/corrupt artifacts fail
explicitly; hashes do not recover manually removed files. Reports are local snapshots, not signed evidence.

## Static walkthrough

```bash
python -m http.server 8080 --directory demo
```

http://localhost:8080 uses synthetic events and simulated queries, without the
backend/models. Its CDN maps/charts need internet.

## Playback and CPU budget

Camera tiles are cached sampled previews. The focused camera defaults to native
recorded playback; choose **Sampled detections** for shared inference overlays and
its measured sampling FPS. Only one video plays, and hidden pages pause media and
polling. The source video and inference sample positions may differ after seeking.

`AI26_CPU_THREADS=2` is the desktop default (range 1–8). The processor uses one
FFmpeg decode thread per source and retains the total sampling budget configured
by `AI26_TOTAL_INFERENCE_FPS`. Changing this budget trades CPU and temporal coverage;
benchmark on the target machine before claiming throughput or detection accuracy.

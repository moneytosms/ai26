# AI26 implementation

## Data path

1. `cameras.py` resolves input files and proxy playback, with explicit availability.
2. FastAPI lifespan starts one `processing.Processor`. A Linux advisory lock
   prevents a second owner of the same data directory. Sequential bounded sampling
   covers every available source without a browser request or growing queue.
3. `inference.py` runs YOLO and, for plate inputs, lazy Fast-ALPR. Camera-local motion/box
   assignment IDs and OCR consensus are scoped to camera/session/track and reset on replay
   loops. Three consistent normalized reads support an identity; conflicting
   reads abstain. Ambiguous association retires implicated old IDs and retains raw
   OCR without a supported identity. Invalid/low-confidence reads stay in history.
4. Typed ingestion writes immutable frame reads and camera-local passage summaries
   to SQLite WAL. Retries of the same session/frame/kind/track are idempotent.
   A contradictory supported identity invalidates its passage for identity queries.
5. The processor saves selected unannotated-frame/crop JPEG derivatives with
   SHA-256 references. Observations contain replay position, processing time,
   session/frame IDs, source clip digest, and model/version metadata. YOLO records
   checkpoint and pipeline digests; exact ALPR weight digests remain pending.
6. Stream/snapshot endpoints read cached annotated JPEGs; previews use cached
   320-pixel JPEGs with ETag revalidation. MJPEG consumers wait asynchronously. MP4 playback never runs
   inference. Health reports availability, errors, FPS, frame age and latency.
7. Repository services derive interval statistics, candidate journeys, editable
   local rules, persistent human review and immutable report snapshots. React
   polls those services and separates explicit walkthroughs from API results.

## Contracts and persistence

`schemas.py` validates finite timestamps/confidence, ordered boxes, query strings
and rule configuration. Invalid requests return a consistent JSON error envelope.
SQLite schema version 3 has sessions, observations, passages, alerts, reports,
settings, audit, report artifact leases, camera revisions and immutable queried
journey-link decisions. Version-1 reports migrate with their leases; version-2
data migrates with a seeded catalog and link storage. Unknown future versions fail.
New observations retain camera metadata snapshots. Legacy reads explicitly use
current-catalog fallback. See [persistence contracts](PERSISTENCE.md) for API edits,
version history and limits. The repository is intended for a
single local API process, not a distributed ingestion deployment.

A read ID identifies an immutable model observation. A passage ID combines camera,
replay session, model kind and local track. Plate and vehicle tracks remain
separate; their association has not been validated. A vehicle passage is counted
once when at least one observation falls in the interval. It is not a unique
city-wide vehicle. Raw reads are API-limited to 5,000; SQL aggregate queries do
not inherit that limit. Default windows expire at read time even if no data arrives.

`ts` is replay observation time; `source_time_seconds` is position in the clip;
`processed_at` is the processing completion time. Original capture timestamps are
unknown. Cross-camera replay clocks cannot support physical travel-time inference.
Those links remain unresolved candidates. For manual observations with confirmed
location labels, the baseline uses exact plate equality and a fixed straight-line
speed gate; coordinate and clock validation are not established by this status;
accepted links still do not prove identity. Rejected links and mixed routes require
review, with null speed for equal/nonpositive timestamps.

Interval-capable routes accept UTC epoch `since`/`until`. Query dates use
`AI26_TIMEZONE`, not the browser's accidental timezone. Supported query grammar
includes one plate/camera, vehicle class, busiest camera, alerts and simple
calendar/time bounds. Multiple identities/clocks and unsupported colors/congestion
are rejected rather than silently broadening a query. There is no LLM, fake SQL,
government registry, permit database or measured congestion classifier.

## Alerts and traffic

Watchlist rules are editable local matches; initial entries are labeled examples.
Restricted-camera rules mean a zone sighting, not an unauthorized-access finding.
Dwell requires one local track inside a configured normalized rectangle over an
elapsed duration, at least three samples, and bounded inter-sample gaps. Exits and
gaps reset it. Review is persistent, but reviewer names are local claims without
authentication or external escalation. Class-only cross-camera re-identification
and six-frame loitering are removed.

Analytics separate raw frame reads, camera-local sampled passages, model confidence
and available/fresh-processing cameras. Accepted-link flows are computed, not fixed
example rows. Activity-map counts do not claim calibrated congestion, occupancy,
road density, traffic speed or historical weekday/hour baselines.

## Reports and retention

Each report stores its exact interval, deduplicated supporting observations, all
raw reads from those passages, raw/canonical OCR, link decisions, artifact references,
provenance, timestamps and limitations. More than 5,000 raw reads requires a shorter
interval. JSON, ZIP and print use that snapshot, regardless of subsequent reads.
SHA-256 hashes canonical JSON excluding its own hash field; artifact bytes must
match their referenced digests. Packages over 64 MiB are refused. Print contains
both passage observations and supporting raw reads, rather than the dashboard.

Reports expire after 24 hours. A separate lifespan maintenance thread cleans
expired reports/leases and seven-day sources every minute, including when inference
is disabled or fails. Active reports protect their existing source images until
report expiry; version-1 reports receive leases during migration. Report creation
checks referenced images and acquires leases under the same repository lock as
cleanup. Missing or corrupt images reject creation; later manual file removal or
corruption still fails download explicitly. A model input frame is a decoded JPEG
**derivative**, not the original recording. The source clip digest identifies that
recording. Hashes are not signatures, authenticated chain of custody, or proof of
correct OCR. Report accesses and review changes receive local audit records;
access controls, tamper-resistant audit storage and signing remain pending.

## Validation and remaining gates

Unit/contract tests use temporary storage and deterministic fixtures. The
`evaluation/` CLI measures box precision/recall, exact OCR strings/abstentions,
ID switches, visible-track fragmentation, link/rule decisions and passage error. Its example is synthetic and
cannot establish real accuracy. Held-out tracking accuracy, independently split data, measured
fusion gains, calibration, labeled adverse conditions, original recording clocks,
and sustained target-hardware benchmarks remain release gates.

See `PROGRESS.md` for every task from the implementation plan. Core engineering
improvements do not satisfy missing-footage accuracy gates. Optional restoration,
learned identity/topology, RTSP integration and production deployment remain
separate, unimplemented work packages.

## Desktop performance

The wall mounts six 320×180 sampled previews and one focused native MP4 player.
Switch to “Sampled detections” for the shared annotated stream, which shows its
actual low sampling FPS. Playback has no detection overlay and can be paused or
seeked independently; it does not seek the shared processor. Media starts after
the intro is dismissed. Hidden pages stop polling, abort pending reads and pause
playback; return triggers refresh. Serial polling cannot pile up overlapping
requests. Analytics/activity share the root camera catalog, and the log requests
only its most recent 40 rows. The CPU default uses two Torch intra-op threads and
one FFmpeg decoder thread per capture; `AI26_CPU_THREADS` permits 1–8 Torch threads.

See `PERFORMANCE.md` for measured results and their limits. Sparse sampling remains
an accuracy limitation; these changes do not claim real-time full-frame inference.

## Local association

`tracking.py` retains the public `CentroidTracker` name for compatibility. Its
implementation now predicts box motion from the last two observed positions,
gates class/size/shape/distance, and solves a global assignment with explicit
unmatched choices. Near-equal competing assignments retire implicated old tracks
and assign fresh ambiguous IDs. The plate pipeline keeps raw/canonical strings
but abstains from supporting identity for those associations. Track histories
contain observed positions only; they never present predicted motion as evidence.

Tracks expire after at most 12 elapsed seconds or the configured missed-frame
bound. The processor resets trackers/fusion at replay/session boundaries.
Observations include association status/cost and tracker version. Cost is a
heuristic used for local association, not a probability or human verification.
Sparse samples, nonlinear motion, similar boxes and camera occlusion can still
fragment tracks or overcount passages. Vehicle/plate tracks remain separate;
learned appearance and validated vehicle/plate linkage are not implemented.

See `TRACKING.md` for synthetic tests, timing samples and evaluation requirements.

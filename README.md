# AI26 — Multi-camera vehicle analytics

Independent AI course project for recorded-camera vehicle detection, plate OCR,
candidate journeys, local rule review, and traffic activity. The SIH submission
and competition materials remain in the original Godseye repository.

One background processor samples every available camera. Browser streams and
snapshots consume its cached output; opening more viewers does not add inference
workers. Six included vehicle clips work locally. CAM-07–09 need readable plate
footage before real OCR and cross-camera accuracy can be evaluated.

## Start

On Linux, install Python 3.12, Node.js 22.12+ with npm, and `uv`, then run:

```bash
uv run run.py
```

Open **http://localhost:5174**, API **http://127.0.0.1:8001**. The frozen lock uses
CPU PyTorch on Linux. After the first installation, restart with
`uv run run.py --skip-install`. See [RUN.md](RUN.md) for configuration and checks.

## Working functionality

- YOLO detections, local motion/box association with ambiguity abstention, and shared annotated feeds.
- SQLite observations, replay sessions, deduplicated passages, review history,
  local rules, versioned camera metadata, queried journey decisions, report snapshots,
  and audit records that survive API restart.
- Per-camera/per-track OCR consensus with abstention on conflicting reads;
  raw, failed, and canonical OCR reads remain separate.
- True empty investigations, explicit walkthrough selection, time filters, and
  distinct accepted/rejected/unresolved candidate paths.
- Editable local watchlists, zone sightings, elapsed-time dwell rules, and review.
- Actual processing health, sampled passage counts, and computed accepted-link
  flow counts. Model confidence is labeled separately from measured accuracy.
- Bounded rule-based plate/camera/class/date queries; no LLM or registry lookup.
- Immutable JSON reports, verified frame/crop ZIP packages, dedicated print/PDF
  views, expiry enforcement, and empty-report rejection.
- Isolated regression tests, a reproducible evaluation CLI, and CI configuration.

## Limits and remaining work

Recorded clips have replay timestamps, not synchronized original capture times.
Their cross-camera links remain unresolved candidates. Heuristic local tracking and OCR
are not validated identity systems; passage counts are camera-local sampled
counts, not unique vehicles across the city. Occupancy, calibrated speed,
historical congestion, fuzzy plate linking, learned appearance tracking, held-out accuracy
measurements, production access controls, and optional weather restoration are
pending. A hash detects changes to a report; it is not a digital signature.

The separate `demo/` walkthrough is synthetic. Missing cameras and empty
investigations never receive its observations automatically.

Camera metadata revisions and queried journey-link history are durable in schema 3.
